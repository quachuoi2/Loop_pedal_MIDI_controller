# Looper

The main idea of the project is to recreate the foot pedal board that Ed Sheeran uses in his live performances:

As it turns out, it is a MIDI controller station, which he uses to control Ableton live/MÃ¶bius 2.

For this project, the device uses an Arduino Nano microcontroller to take human input and send it as MIDI OUT data to a MIDI IN port. In my case, I am using the AudioBox USB96 interface.

Both the Arduino Nano and the Audio interface is connect to the PC via USB.

The foot pedal is soldered to jumper wires to create modular connection to the breadboard.
